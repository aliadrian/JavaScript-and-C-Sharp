// Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame bas sorting method there) with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number n of smallest elements to return.

// Also:

// the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the array/list/vector length;
// elements can be duplicated;
// in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).
// Same examples and more in the test cases:

// firstNSmallest([1,2,3,4,5],3) === [1,2,3] //well, not technically ===, but you get what I mean
// firstNSmallest([5,4,3,2,1],3) === [3,2,1]
// firstNSmallest([1,2,3,4,1],3) === [1,2,1]
// firstNSmallest([1,2,3,-4,0],3) === [1,-4,0]
// firstNSmallest([1,2,3,4,5],0) === []

function firstNSmallest(array, n) {
  let list = array.slice();

  while (list.length > n) {
    const max = Math.max(...list);
    const index = list.lastIndexOf(max);
    list.splice(index, 1);
  }

  return list;
}
